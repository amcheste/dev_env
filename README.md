# Alan's Development Environment

This project provides the ability for me to quickly setup a development environment on a Mac OSX.

## Setup

To install the development environment execute `./setup.sh`.

This script will create the desired repo structure and install depedencies using homebrew.

### .vim

The following will override your `.vimrc`:
`$ cp vimrc ~/.vimrc`

### .zsh

The follwoing will override your `.zshrc`:
`$ cp zshrc ~/.zshrc`

## Manual Steps

You must still manually install:
* Docker Desktop
* VS Code
* Git
